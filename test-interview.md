# Testing the New AI Interviewer Content Script

## Quick Setup

1. **Build the extension:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Load in Chrome:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder

3. **Configure API Key:**
   - Click the LeetMentor extension icon
   - Go to Settings and enter your OpenAI API key

## Testing Flow

1. **Navigate to a LeetCode problem:**
   - Go to any problem like: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
   - Wait for the page to fully load

2. **AI Interviewer should automatically inject:**
   - You should see a purple gradient chat interface at the top of the problem description
   - The AI will greet you with a welcome message

3. **Interview Flow to Test:**

   **Phase 1: Problem Understanding**
   - AI asks you to explain the problem in your own words
   - Try responding with something like: "We need to find two numbers in an array that sum to a target"

   **Phase 2: Approach Discussion** 
   - AI will ask about different approaches
   - Try: "I could use a brute force approach checking all pairs, or use a hash map for O(n) solution"

   **Phase 3: Complexity Analysis**
   - AI will ask about time/space complexity
   - Try: "The hash map approach is O(n) time and O(n) space"

   **Phase 4: Implementation**
   - AI will direct you to code in the LeetCode editor
   - Write your solution in the LeetCode editor below

   **Phase 5: Testing & Review**
   - Submit your solution in LeetCode
   - The AI will automatically detect the submission result and provide feedback

## Key Features to Test

### âœ… Automatic Problem Detection
- Should work on any LeetCode problem page
- Interface should inject automatically

### âœ… Smart Navigation Handling
- Navigate to different problems - interface should reset and inject on new problems
- No duplicate interfaces should appear

### âœ… AI Interview Flow
- AI should guide through structured interview phases
- Phase indicator should update at the top of the interface

### âœ… Submission Monitoring
- Submit code in LeetCode editor
- AI should automatically detect "Accepted", "Wrong Answer", etc.
- Provides intelligent feedback based on results

### âœ… Error Handling
- Works without API key (shows helpful error)
- Graceful fallbacks if injection fails
- Clear error messages for API issues

## Debugging

Open Chrome DevTools Console to see logs:
- `ðŸš€ LeetMentor AI Interviewer: Content script loading...`
- `âœ… Detected LeetCode problem page`
- `âœ… Problem detected: [Problem Name]`
- `ðŸ’‰ Injecting AI Interviewer interface...`
- `ðŸ“Š Submission result detected: [Result]`

## Console Commands for Testing

```javascript
// Check if interviewer is loaded
window.leetmentorAI

// Force problem re-detection
window.leetmentorAI.detectProblem()

// Check current problem data
window.leetmentorAI.problem
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Clean Interface:** Modern purple gradient design that integrates well with LeetCode
2. **Smart AI:** Context-aware responses that guide through realistic interview flow
3. **Automatic Detection:** No manual setup required - just navigate to LeetCode problems
4. **Submission Integration:** Automatically detects and responds to LeetCode submission results
5. **Error Recovery:** Handles API errors gracefully with helpful messages

## Differences from Previous Versions

- **Simplified:** No complex voice features, just clean chat interface
- **Focused:** Specifically designed for interview practice flow
- **Reliable:** Better problem detection and interface injection
- **Smart:** Phase-aware AI that guides through proper interview structure
- **Integrated:** Seamless submission monitoring and feedback

The new content script is much more focused and reliable than the previous complex versions!
